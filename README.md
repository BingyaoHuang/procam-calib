A Fast and Flexible Projector-Camera Calibration System [IEEE T-ASE 2020]
===

## Introduction
A fast and flexible projector-camera calibration system that is single-shot-per-pose and deals with imperfect planarity of the calibration target. 

Highlights:
* The system explicitly deals with the noise due to imperfect planarity with a novel **bundle adjustment** solution. 
* Our calibration system applies **structured light (SL) pattern keypoints** rather than checkerboard corners. This strategy boosts both the number of keypoints and their spatial distribution, and hence improves calibration robustness.
* Our system requires **only a single shot per pose**, making it practically convenient in many applications.
* A practical **open source projector-camera calibration software** with GUI is provided to benefit the society.
